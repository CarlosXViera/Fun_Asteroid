# Deep Space
This game was inspired by the retro-game asteroids. It was an especially nostalgic game for me. The main point of this project was to incorporate all that we have learned in CST 2301 Mobile Programming. So, I decided to create something close to home. Took me quite some time and there are more things to fix, but I'm very proud of my progress. Learned much about the Canvas, intents, fragments, openGl (although I did not use it), lifecycle callbacks, and so much more. Here are some screen shots and video of the game in action.
